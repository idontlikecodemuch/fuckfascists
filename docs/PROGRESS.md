## Recent Sessions (most recent first)

### Session: March 23, 2026 (accessibility audit & fix)
**Focus:** Full-codebase accessibility audit — labels, hints, roles, states, tap targets — across all surfaces. Cross-referenced against copy/ layer. Fixed all actionable issues.

**What changed:**
1. **Copy keys added** — `scan.ts` (+2: `primaryActionLabel`, `busyActionLabel`), `map.ts` (+5: `tabLabel`, `barcodePermissionActionLabel`, `barcodeSettingsActionLabel`, `barcodeCameraLabel`, `chooserModalLabel`), `platforms.ts` (+1: `tabLabel`), `info.ts` (+3: `tabLabel`, `transparencyToggleLabel`, `versionLabel`).
2. **Critical fixes — missing all a11y on interactive elements:** ScanScreen CTA (added `accessibilityRole`, `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityState`), BarcodeScannerSheet permission buttons (added role + label), ScanScreen heading (added `accessibilityRole="header"`).
3. **Modal focus trapping added:** BarcodeScannerSheet root (`accessibilityViewIsModal`), MatchChooser card (`accessibilityViewIsModal` + label).
4. **Missing `accessibilityState` added:** MapControls location button (`disabled`), PlatformRow body (`expanded`), PlatformGroupHeader (`expanded`), Platforms AvoidButton (`selected`).
5. **Tap target fixes:** UnmatchedBanner FEC link (added `hitSlop` + `minHeight: 44`), BarcodeScannerSheet close button (added `minHeight: 44` + `hitSlop`), DayCircles `hitSlop` increased 4→8.
6. **Decorative elements hidden:** PlatformRow expand indicator (`accessible={false}`), BarcodeScannerSheet scan guide (`accessible={false}`), BarcodeScannerSheet camera (`accessibilityLabel`).
7. **InfoScreen fixes:** Transparency toggle (added `accessibilityLabel`), version tap (added `accessibilityRole="button"` + `accessibilityLabel`).
8. **Tab bar hardcoded labels extracted** — all 4 hardcoded tab labels replaced with imports from respective copy files.
9. **BarcodeScannerSheet title** — added `accessibilityRole="header"`.
10. **Verification** — 320 tests, 30 suites, all pass.

**Follow-up fixes (human decisions resolved):**
11. **ScorecardView inline links** — accepted as intentional 44pt exception; added code comment documenting rationale (empty-state reading flow, VoiceOver reachable).
12. **ScorecardView allowFontScaling={false}** — accepted for V1; added docblock comment explaining why (react-native-view-shot bitmap capture requires fixed layout).
13. **GameArena reduced motion** — added `AccessibilityInfo.isReduceMotionEnabled()` check; pulse and cross-fade animations gated on `!reducedMotion`. Decorative background hidden from screen readers.
14. **Map AvoidButton console.log** — removed leftover `console.log('[AvoidButton] Firing haptic feedback')` from production path.
15. **InfoScreen page title** — changed `allowFontScaling={false}` to `allowFontScaling` (Dynamic Type enabled).
16. **Copy naming cleanup** — deferred to pre-1.0 pass (no runtime impact, cosmetic only). Logged in "What's Not Working" table below.

### Session: March 23, 2026 (entity/person reconciliation + V1/V2 split)
**Focus:** Reconcile `entities.json` against the new people pass without letting V2-only donor/company links pollute the live V1 entity graph.

**What changed:**
1. **Repeatable verification added** — created `scripts/verify-data-integrity.mjs` to audit duplicate IDs, forward refs, reverse-link gaps, role mismatches, GPT pass integrity, and stale docs.
2. **V1/V2 crossover cleaned up** — created `scripts/reconcile-v1-entities.mjs`, added reverse `associatedPersonIds` to live entities, and kept `entities.json` aligned only to live V1 IDs.
3. **Deferred V2 links preserved, not lost** — kept non-live people→entity links in `people.json` as declared forward refs and mirrored them into `tools/fec-bulk/reports/people-v2-deferred-entity-links.json` so the data stays recoverable and reviewable.
4. **Live entity collisions reduced** — trimmed parent-child alias/domain duplication for existing child entities (for example Microsoft/LinkedIn/GitHub, Amazon/Twitch/Ring, Recruit/Indeed/Glassdoor, LVMH/Sephora, Shell/Jiffy Lube) and removed a few web-verified stale overlaps such as Marathon→Speedway, Verizon→Yahoo/AOL, and Adobe→Figma.
5. **Docs/memory synced** — updated `CLAUDE.md` and `SPEC_VS_CURRENT.md` so they match the current live rule set and `PoliticalPerson` schema.
6. **Verification** — `node scripts/verify-data-integrity.mjs`, `npx jest --runInBand core/data/__tests__/personList.test.ts`, `npx jest --runInBand core/models/__tests__/person.test.ts`, and `npm run typecheck` rerun after reconciliation.

### Session: March 22, 2026 (barcode scan crash fix + runtime hardening)
**Focus:** Remove the Scan tab crash, keep the implementation lightweight, and document the final stable flow.

**What changed:**
1. **Crash root cause fixed** — added `NSCameraUsageDescription` to the native iOS app target so requesting camera access no longer risks an OS-level crash.
2. **Scanner mount path simplified** — `BarcodeScannerSheet` is now mounted only after the user taps `OPEN SCANNER`, which keeps camera setup contextual and avoids touching the preview while the Scan tab is idle.
3. **Native handling corrected** — removed the old `CameraView.isAvailableAsync()` gate from the native flow and switched to permission-state UI plus `onMountError`, matching Expo Camera's documented surface more closely.
4. **Permission recovery improved** — when camera permission has already been denied, the scan sheet now offers an `Open settings` path instead of repeatedly prompting.
5. **Permission scope reduced** — set `recordAudioAndroid: false` for `expo-camera`, so the barcode feature does not request unnecessary microphone/audio access on Android.
6. **Documentation updated** — hardened BARCODE_SCAN_V1.md, SPEC_VS_CURRENT.md, and ARCHITECTURE.md to reflect the final implementation rather than just the first rollout.
7. **Verification** — `npm run typecheck`, focused scan Jest tests, and `plutil -lint ios/FckFascists/Info.plist` passed. Full iOS simulator build verification remained partially blocked by the local Xcode/CoreSimulator/CocoaPods environment.

### Session: March 22, 2026 (barcode scanning v1 + dedicated Scan tab)
**Focus:** Add a product barcode scan flow that works in-store without shipping a massive bundled product database.

**What changed:**
1. **New top-level Scan destination** — added a dedicated `SCAN BETA` tab instead of hiding barcode scan inside Map. The flow is now a first-class product surface with its own CTA, permission timing, and result state, while staying clearly marked as test-only navigation for now.
2. **Camera scanner added** — installed `expo-camera`, configured the app plugin, and built `BarcodeScannerSheet` with `UPC-A`/`EAN-13` only, which keeps the scan path narrow and fast.
3. **Barcode resolution stays lightweight** — scan results normalize to GTIN-13, hit a local SQLite barcode cache first, and only call Open Food Facts on cache miss. Repeat scans stay local to the device.
4. **No giant product DB** — the implementation reuses bundled entity aliases as the brand-to-parent-company graph. No `product.json` or top-100 product bundle was added.
5. **Result flow reused, not duplicated** — once a brand resolves, the existing entity/FEC card path is reused. `BusinessCard` now shows a `SCANNED PRODUCT` context block so users can tell a shelf scan from a map match.
6. **Documentation added** — created BARCODE_SCAN_V1.md with architecture notes, source rationale, known risks, and explicit rollback steps.
7. **Verification** — `npx tsc --noEmit` passed and `npx jest --runInBand` passed with 320 tests across 30 suites.
8. **Tab bar bleed fixed** — removed the scaled repeat transform from the bottom-nav stone texture and clipped the tab bar bounds so the texture no longer paints upward over screen content.

### Session: March 21, 2026 (Track list visual hierarchy + sprite fallback polish)
**Focus:** Make grouped platform rows read more clearly as children and clean up the small platform-list sprite treatment.

**What changed:**
1. **Hierarchy styling improved** — child rows under group headers now use a deeper indent, smaller name/count type, a connector guide, and a softer nested background tint so they read as sub-items instead of peers.
2. **Platform busts simplified** — singleton platform rows now always use the neutral sprite bust, which avoids clipping defeated-state stars/halos inside tiny list crops.
3. **Bust crop relaxed** — shared platform-row bust crop constants were retuned slightly wider and less top-biased so faces sit more naturally in the small list tiles.
4. **Missing art fallback added** — introduced `FigureBadge` for Track. When a sprite is missing from the manifest, the UI now renders a monogram badge instead of a blank box. This fixes the visible YouTube/Sundar gap without needing new art immediately.
5. **Verification** — `npx tsc --noEmit` passed and `npx jest --runInBand` passed with 314 tests across 29 suites.

### Session: March 21, 2026 (Track pivot implementation — data-driven detail rows)
**Focus:** Implement the documented Track pivot so platform expansion stops depending on row-local animated height state.

**What changed:**
1. **Track state simplified** — `TrackContext` now separates `selectedPlatformId`, `openPlatformId`, and `focusedFigureName`, which removes the old overloaded focus token and the `expandedIds` set.
2. **List behavior rebuilt around data, not hidden animation state** — `TrackList` now inserts a real `dayCircles` item under the open platform row and uses `LayoutAnimation` for open/close transitions.
3. **Daily preview simplified** — the once-per-day ripple now lives locally in `TrackList` as a temporary set of open detail rows that collapse in sequence and cancel immediately on interaction.
4. **Day circles made presentational again** — `DayCircles` is now a plain detail row instead of an internally animated height container.
5. **Arena background direction aligned with the pivot** — `GameArena` is back on `cover` with the existing background color/overlay acting as the fallback layer; dynamic resize-mode switching was removed.
6. **Shared crop rule kept simple** — no per-sprite metadata was added. The same shared crop constants continue to drive both `2x2` and `2x1` sheets.
7. **Verification** — `npx tsc --noEmit` passed and `npx jest --runInBand` passed with 314 tests across 29 suites.

### Session: March 21, 2026 (Track pivot planning — simplify list behavior and sprite crop)
**Focus:** Stop iterating on the fragile inline day-circle animation and document a simpler Track implementation path before another code pass.

**What changed:**
1. **Platform interaction pivot documented** — added TRACK_PLATFORM_PIVOT.md describing the move from row-local animated height to a data-driven `dayCircles` detail item inserted directly into `FlatList` data.
2. **Internet vetting recorded** — the pivot is now grounded in the official React batching docs, React Native `FlatList` and `LayoutAnimation` docs, Apple list/disclosure guidance, and the controlled accordion pattern.
3. **Sprite crop simplification validated** — visually sampled 10 random sprite sheets across both `2x2` and `2x1` tiers. All sampled sheets use the same `728x720` frame geometry, and the face anchor is consistent enough to justify one shared crop rule rather than per-sprite metadata.
4. **Arena background direction simplified** — the pivot note now keeps arena art on `cover` and recommends only a color/texture fallback layer underneath, matching the fact that the background assets were painted to crop well.

### Session: March 21, 2026 (Track follow-up — row tap expansion + crop alignment + arena background fit)
**Focus:** Fix the remaining Track complaints after the v3 rebuild: row taps still feeling non-responsive, faces still clipping inside the sprite crop, and arena backgrounds looking zoomed on narrower assets.

**What changed:**
1. **Row-body expansion made atomic** — added a reducer-level `press-expandable-row` action so row taps and checkmark taps do not branch on a render-time `focused` prop. A row tap now opens that row immediately and a second tap collapses it.
2. **Sprite crop corrected in both axes** — `SpriteView` now supports `cropOffsetX` in addition to `cropOffsetY`. Track bust/grid/single-character crops are nudged slightly left and up so the face stays inside the square window instead of clipping against the top/right edge of the frame.
3. **Arena background fit corrected** — `GameArena` now picks `cover` only when the selected arena asset aspect ratio is already close to the live arena ratio, and uses `contain` for squarer backgrounds so they stop appearing zoomed in.
4. **Regression expectations updated** — `trackUIState.test.ts` now reflects the one-tap row-open behavior and verifies that switching rows collapses the prior row while opening the newly selected one.

### Session: March 21, 2026 (Track screen rebuild v3 — reducer-driven focus + FlatList restore)
**Focus:** Re-architect the Track screen interaction model so focus, arena state, and day-circle expansion stay in sync. Fix the broken expand/collapse behavior, restore the spec'd `FlatList` layout, and enforce one platform avoid per day.

**Changes:**
1. **Track screen structure restored** — `TrackScreen` is back to `TrackProvider` → `TrackHeader` → `GameArena` → `TrackList` (`FlatList`, only scrollable element). Removed the stray main-screen `Clear data` action from the header.
2. **Reducer-driven Track UI state** — focus and expansion logic moved into `context/trackUIState.ts` so row focus, group focus, and checkmark expand/collapse happen through one state machine instead of competing `setState` calls. Added `focusedFigureName` + `arenaHitRequest` bridge in `TrackContext`.
3. **List components made prop-driven again** — `TrackList.tsx` now owns `FlatList` render branching and passes explicit props into `PlatformGroupHeader` and `PlatformRow`. Day circles expand correctly on focused-row body taps and checkmark taps, and previous expansions collapse on focus shifts.
4. **Daily open animation fixed** — first visit to Track each calendar day now checks a persisted SecureStore date (`track_daily_open_last_visit`), opens all rows once, then stagger-collapses them. No AppState/focus/unfocus trigger.
5. **Arena rebuilt** — random background on mount, full tracked roster in the neutral character-select grid, larger/corrected sprite crop math via `SpriteView.cropRatio`, left-weighted single-character portrait, same-person sibling pulse instead of full transition, and coordinate-aware arena FX positioning.
6. **Platform avoid model corrected** — `recordPlatformAvoid*()` now no-op when a platform/date is already logged, platform weekly reads normalize legacy overcounted records to binary per day, and Track/Scorecard tests were updated to the new one-per-day semantics.

**Files created:** `features/Platforms/components/TrackList.tsx`, `features/Platforms/context/trackUIState.ts`, `features/Platforms/context/trackHelpers.ts`
**Files rebuilt:** `features/Platforms/TrackScreen.tsx`, `features/Platforms/context/TrackContext.tsx`, `features/Platforms/components/GameArena.tsx`, `features/Platforms/components/TrackHeader.tsx`, `features/Platforms/components/PlatformGroupHeader.tsx`, `features/Platforms/components/PlatformRow.tsx`
**Files modified:** `features/Platforms/components/ArenaFX.tsx`, `features/Platforms/components/AvoidButton.tsx`, `features/Platforms/components/DayCircles.tsx`, `features/Platforms/hooks/usePlatformAvoidance.ts`, `core/data/eventStore.ts`, `core/sprites/spriteLoader.tsx`, `config/constants.ts`, `design/tokens.ts`, `features/Scorecard/data/__tests__/aggregateScorecard.test.ts`, `docs/PROGRESS.md`
**Follow-up validation:** added user-flow regression coverage in `features/Platforms/__tests__/trackUIState.test.ts` and a rollback/architect note in `docs/TRACK_SCREEN_V3_NOTES.md` documenting the failure mode in prior commit `795e7d8`, the new pressure-test matrix, and exact rollback commands.

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit` clean. `npx jest --runInBand` clean — 314 tests passing (29 suites).

### Session: March 20, 2026 (Track screen rebuild v2 — component extraction + todayActions)
**Focus:** Second-pass rebuild of the Track screen. Extracted monolithic TrackRow/TrackList into focused single-responsibility components. Defeated state now driven by todayActions (any avoid = defeated) instead of weekly threshold.

**Changes:**
1. **Deleted old files:** `TrackList.tsx`, `TrackRow.tsx` (both accumulated too many responsibilities in v1 rebuild)
2. **New component architecture:**
   - `components/AvoidButton.tsx` (75 lines) — ONE Pressable, TWO visual states. "AVOID" (green bg, white text) → checkmark (muted bg, green text). Driven by `avoidedToday` boolean prop.
   - `components/PlatformGroupHeader.tsx` (93 lines) — sprite bust (always neutral) + short parent name + roll-up avoid count. Tap focuses first child platform.
   - `components/PlatformRow.tsx` (220 lines) — handles both `childRow` and `platformRow` types via `isChild` prop. Two tap zones: row body (focus/expand/collapse cycle) and AvoidButton. DayCircles always mounted with animated height.
   - `components/ArenaFX.tsx` (107 lines) — extracted from GameArena: SpeechBubbleFX, FloatingMinusOneFX, `arenaFXRegistry`.
   - `utils/listData.ts` (62 lines) — extracted from TrackScreen: `TrackListItem` union type and `buildListData()` function.
   - `components/GameArena.tsx` (209 lines) — rebuilt. Grid sprites ALWAYS neutral. Single character uses `todayActions.has()` for defeated state. `fireHitFX` static property for parent communication.
   - `components/TrackHeader.tsx` (94 lines) — rebuilt. No screen title (tab says TRACK). Top row: week label + "Edit platforms" (underlined). Count area: avoid count when >0, "LET'S GO!!!!" pump-up when 0.
   - `TrackScreen.tsx` (195 lines) — rebuilt. Contains `TrackScreen` (root) and `TrackListInner`. Daily open animation with per-day tracking via `dailyOpenDateRef`.
3. **TrackContext rebuilt** (161 lines) — `isDefeated()` now returns `todayActions.has(figureName)` instead of `personWeeklyAvoids() >= SPRITE_DEFEATED_THRESHOLD`. `avoidForDate()` adds to todayActions for any date including past-day backfills.
4. **DayCircles rebuilt** (140 lines) — uses `TRACK_DAY_CIRCLE_SIZE` and `TRACK_DAY_CIRCLES_GAP` constants.
5. **Copy updates:** removed old keys (`title`, `score`, old `avoidedBtn`/`avoidedLabel`/`notAvoidedLabel`/`editBtn`/`editLabel`/`groupHeader`/`arenaTitle`). Added: `editPlatforms`, `editPlatformsA11y`, `avoidCountLabel`, `pumpUp`, new `avoidedBtn` (checkmark), `avoidBtnA11y`, `avoidedBtnA11y`, `countDash`, `expandIndicator`, `collapseIndicator`, `groupHeaderA11y`. Changed `countLabel` format from `x{n}` to `{n}x`.
6. **Constants updates:** renamed `ARENA_MAX_HEIGHT` to `ARENA_HEIGHT = 200`. Removed `SPRITE_DEFEATED_THRESHOLD`. Added 16 `TRACK_*` layout tuning constants.

**Screen layout:** Plain flex column. TrackHeader (auto height) → GameArena (fixed 200pt) → FlatList (flex: 1, only scrollable element). No sticky headers, no nested scrolling.

**Files created:** features/Platforms/components/AvoidButton.tsx, features/Platforms/components/PlatformGroupHeader.tsx, features/Platforms/components/PlatformRow.tsx, features/Platforms/components/ArenaFX.tsx, features/Platforms/utils/listData.ts
**Files rebuilt:** features/Platforms/TrackScreen.tsx, features/Platforms/context/TrackContext.tsx, features/Platforms/components/TrackHeader.tsx, features/Platforms/components/GameArena.tsx, features/Platforms/components/DayCircles.tsx
**Files modified:** copy/platforms.ts, config/constants.ts, docs/PROGRESS.md, CLAUDE.md
**Files deleted:** features/Platforms/components/TrackList.tsx, features/Platforms/components/TrackRow.tsx

**Kept unchanged:** hooks (usePlatformAvoidance, usePlatformRoster, useNudgeNotification), utils (weekDates, platformHelpers), types.ts, platformList.ts, PlatformSetupScreen.tsx, NudgeBanner.tsx, all tests

**Verification:** 295 tests pass (27 suites). All files under 250-line limit.

### Session: March 19, 2026 (Shared FX system + App.tsx extraction + people.json docs)
**Focus:** Three infrastructure tasks — no UI changes.

**Changes:**
1. **Shared FX system (`core/fx/`)** — replaces CelebrationOverlay with a generic, extensible effects system.
   - `types.ts` — FXEntry, FXScope ('point'|'area'|'full'), FXComponentProps, FXRegistration
   - `useFX.ts` — fire-and-forget hook: `fire(type, scope, meta?)`, `remove(id)`, `entries[]`, `active`, `reducedMotion`
   - `FXLayer.tsx` — host component that renders active effects from a registry
   - `registry.ts` — default registry with built-in `avoid` effect
   - `effects/AvoidCelebration.tsx` — migrated from CelebrationOverlay (scale+fade, reduced motion support)
   - `index.ts` — barrel export
   - `config/constants.ts` — added `FX_AVOID_DURATION_MS = 3000`, `FX_AVOID_FADE_MS = 400`
   - **MapScreen.tsx** — replaced `CelebrationOverlay` imports + `celebrations[]` state + `reducedMotionRef` with `useFX()` + `<FXLayer>`. Removed `AccessibilityInfo` import.
   - **Deleted** `features/Map/components/CelebrationOverlay.tsx`

2. **App.tsx extraction** — split monolithic App.tsx into gate components.
   - `app/gates/OnboardingGate.tsx` — wraps `useOnboarding` + conditional `OnboardingNavigator`
   - `app/gates/LaunchGate.tsx` — wraps `shouldShowLaunchScreen()` + conditional `LaunchScreen`
   - `app/gates/AppShell.tsx` — tab navigation, screen rendering, beta overlay, FEC client
   - **App.tsx** reduced from 226 to 112 lines: fonts → data init → splash → gate chain

3. **People.json architecture documentation**
   - **CLAUDE.md** — expanded Entity Relationships: bidirectional linkage model, full PoliticalPerson schema with all fields, integrity rules, getPersonDisplayName. Updated repo structure (added `app/gates/`, `core/fx/`). Updated sprint focus table.
   - **SPEC_VS_CURRENT.md** — people.json row updated from "Deferred — V1.5" to "In progress" with current state. 8-bit design system entry updated to reflect FXLayer.

**Files created:** core/fx/types.ts, core/fx/useFX.ts, core/fx/FXLayer.tsx, core/fx/registry.ts, core/fx/effects/AvoidCelebration.tsx, core/fx/index.ts, app/gates/OnboardingGate.tsx, app/gates/LaunchGate.tsx, app/gates/AppShell.tsx
**Files modified:** App.tsx, features/Map/MapScreen.tsx, features/Map/components/BusinessCard.tsx (comment), config/constants.ts, CLAUDE.md, docs/SPEC_VS_CURRENT.md, docs/PROGRESS.md
**Files deleted:** features/Map/components/CelebrationOverlay.tsx

**Verification:** 307 tests pass (28 suites).

### Session: March 19, 2026 (AIRMap.m post_install patch hook)
**Focus:** Automate the AIRMap.m nil guard patch so it survives `pod install`.

**Changes:**
- **ios/Podfile** — added `post_install` hook that reads `node_modules/react-native-maps/ios/AirMaps/AIRMap.m` and injects nil guards on `insertReactSubview:atIndex:`, `removeReactSubview:`, and `addSubview:` if missing. Idempotent — detects existing guards and skips. Prints confirmation via `Pod::UI.puts` when patch is applied.
- **CLAUDE.md** — updated Modern Code Standards bullet (native guard is now auto-applied by Podfile hook). Updated Known Limitations section: AIRMap.m nil guard patch marked as Resolved.

**Files modified:** ios/Podfile, CLAUDE.md, docs/PROGRESS.md

**Verification:** 295 tests pass (27 suites). Patch idempotency confirmed via Ruby dry-run against both patched and simulated unpatched sources.

### Session: March 18, 2026 (BusinessCard rebuild + component extraction)
**Focus:** Complete BusinessCard rebuild — deleted old component, split into clean composable pieces, moved celebration to screen level, extracted map controls hook.

**Changes:**
- **Deleted** old `BusinessCard.tsx` (accumulated ad hoc patches, broken view hierarchy, celebration code mixed in)
- **Created `DataZone.tsx`** — self-contained donation data display: total since 2016 (GOP/DEM), recent cycle, active cycles, PAC attribution, FEC link. Three states: real donations, no donations on file, data unavailable.
- **Created `DetailSheet.tsx`** — placeholder for future expanded data view (no-op for V1)
- **Rebuilt `BusinessCard.tsx`** (168 lines) — clean three-section layout: sprite perch above card (overflow visible, marginBottom -40, zIndex 20), name section (brand + parent attribution + confidence badge), DataZone, AvoidButton + dismiss. `accessibilityViewIsModal`, post-avoid screen reader announcement via `AccessibilityInfo.announceForAccessibility`.
- **Created `BusinessBanner.tsx`** (114 lines) — lightweight banner for non-card states. `resolveCardMode()` function determines card vs banner: checks entity presence, fecCommitteeId, donationSummary all-zeros. Four banner variants: no_match, lookup_failed, no_pac, dissolved.
- **Created `CelebrationOverlay.tsx`** (66 lines) — screen-level celebration effect extracted from old card. Respects reduced motion (static checkmark vs animated scale+fade). `CELEBRATION_DURATION_MS = 3000`. Array-based registry in MapScreen for extensibility.
- **Extracted `useMapControls.ts`** (73 lines) — zoom in/out, region tracking, initial centering, recenter-on-me. Keeps MapScreen focused on data flow.
- **Rewrote `MapScreen.tsx`** (217 lines) — celebration registry (`CelebrationEffect[]`), card/banner routing via `resolveCardMode()`, `handleNewResult()` for second-tap-replaces-card, `pointerEvents='none'` during celebration, `maxHeight: '65%'` on card container.
- **Updated `copy/map.ts`** — added banner strings (bannerNoMatch, bannerLookupFailed, bannerNoPac, bannerDissolved, bannerDismissLabel), DataZone strings (dataZoneDetail, dataZoneDetailLabel), card accessibility strings (cardAvoidedAnnouncement, cardModalLabel), parent attribution string.
- **Updated `MapSections.tsx`** — new BusinessCard API + BannerNoMatch, BannerNoPac, BannerDissolved catalog sections.
- **Updated `CatalogScreen.tsx`** — banner variants added to SECTIONS array, slice indices adjusted.

**Files created:** BusinessBanner.tsx, CelebrationOverlay.tsx, DataZone.tsx, DetailSheet.tsx, useMapControls.ts
**Files rewritten:** BusinessCard.tsx, MapScreen.tsx
**Files modified:** copy/map.ts, MapSections.tsx, CatalogScreen.tsx

**Architecture:** BusinessCard.tsx re-exports `BusinessBanner` and `resolveCardMode` from BusinessBanner.tsx so existing import paths continue to work. All files under 250-line limit.

**Verification:** tsc clean, 295 tests pass (27 suites)

### Session: March 18, 2026 (map polish + launch screen fix + no-match toast)
**Focus:** Header bar transparent ridge, header-to-search spacing, launch screen auto-dismiss timing, tap no-match feedback

**Changes:**
- **MapScreen.tsx** — added `backgroundColor: bgVoid` to `headerBarOverlay` style so transparent pixels in header_bar.png show the dark background instead of the map bleeding through. Increased header-to-search-bar gap from `theme.space.xs` (4pt) to `theme.space.md` (12pt).
- **LaunchScreen.tsx** — fixed 5s auto-dismiss firing early. Root cause: `onDismiss` prop was an inline arrow function in App.tsx, creating a new reference on every parent re-render. The auto-dismiss `useEffect` depended on `[onDismiss]`, so every parent re-render cleared and restarted the 5s timer. Fix: store `onDismiss` in a ref and run the timer effect once on mount with an empty dependency array.
- **App.tsx** — stabilized `onDismiss` callback with `useCallback` (`dismissLaunch`), providing a stable reference as a belt-and-suspenders complement to the ref fix in LaunchScreen.
- **useTapSearch.ts** — added `tapNoMatch` state: set to `true` for 2s when a map tap finds POI names but none match any entity. Exposed in return value.
- **NoMatchToast.tsx** — new component: brief absolutely-positioned toast ("No match found") shown when `tapNoMatch` is true and no card is active. Uses `accessibilityRole="alert"` for VoiceOver.
- **copy/map.ts** — added `tapNoMatch` copy key.
- **MapScreen.tsx** — wired `tapNoMatch` from `useTapSearch` to render `<NoMatchToast />`.

**Verification:** tsc clean, 295 tests pass

### Session: March 18, 2026 (UI kit revert + header bar fix + sprite overflow)
**Focus:** Partial revert of UI kit wiring (assets don't fit at current sizes), header bar sizing fix, sprite overflow fix

**Changes:**
- **Reverted UI kit wiring** from 6 components — sliced assets remain in `assets/pixel/ui/` but are no longer wired into BusinessCard, AvoidButton, MapSearchBar, TabBar, MapControls, or ScorecardView. All components restored to pre-UI-kit coded borders/styling. `core/ui/uiAssets.ts` and header bar wiring in MapScreen retained.
- **MapScreen.tsx** — header bar height now derived from screen width via `useWindowDimensions` + aspect ratio (1482/153) instead of hardcoded 60px. Image uses `resizeMode="stretch"` for full-width fill. Logo vertically centered within the stone area above the crumbling edge.
- **BusinessCard.tsx** — explicit `overflow: 'visible'` on `whoSection`, `whoRow`, and `spriteHero` styles to ensure the sprite perch renders outside the card's top edge without clipping. Corner brackets restored.
- Renamed `assets/pixel/UI/` to `assets/pixel/ui/` (lowercase) to fix Metro bundler case-sensitive resolution.

**Verification:** tsc clean, 295 tests pass

### Session: March 18, 2026 (UI kit slicing + component wiring)
**Focus:** UI kit sprite sheet slicing pipeline + wiring pixel art assets into 7 components

**Changes:**
- Created `tools/img-gen/scripts/slice_ui_kit.py` — auto-detects connected non-transparent regions via flood-fill BFS, extracts each as individual transparent PNG. Reusable for any sprite sheet.
- Sliced `ui_kit.png` into 30 elements, saved to `assets/pixel/ui/` with semantic names (frames, buttons, bars, badges, input fields, panels, dividers)
- Created `core/ui/uiAssets.ts` — static require() map for all 30 UI kit elements + header bar
- **MapScreen.tsx** — header bar replaced with `header_bar.png` pixel art asset, overlaid on map with logo on top. Irregular bottom edge is transparent (map visible through gaps). Full SafeAreaView layout restructured.
- **BusinessCard.tsx** — `ImageBackground` with `frame_card_wide.png` replaces coded borders + corner brackets. Corner bracket images removed.
- **AvoidButton.tsx** — `ImageBackground` with `btn_start.png` replaces coded yellow/green background. Frame image hidden on confirmed/error states (solid colors remain).
- **MapSearchBar.tsx** — `ImageBackground` with `input_field.png` wraps TextInput. Search button uses `btn_circle_search.png` Image.
- **TabBar.tsx** — `bar_tab.png` replaces stone tile repeat texture. resizeMode stretch, higher opacity.
- **MapControls.tsx** — `ImageBackground` with circle button assets (`btn_circle_plus`, `btn_circle_arrow`, `btn_circle_target`) replace coded dark square buttons.
- **ScorecardView.tsx** — `ImageBackground` with `frame_scorecard.png` replaces coded hero border.
- Documented `slice_ui_kit.py` in `tools/img-gen/USAGE.md`
- Updated CLAUDE.md repo structure tree (core/ui/, assets/pixel/ui/, slice_ui_kit.py)

**Verification:** tsc clean, 295 tests pass, copy audit clean (dev fixtures only)

### Session: March 18, 2026 (arena assets pattern)
**Focus:** Arena background asset management — arenaAssets.ts require map + build script

**Changes:**
- Created `core/arena/arenaAssets.ts` — static `require()` map for arena backgrounds, following the `spriteAssets.ts` pattern
- Created `scripts/generate-arena-assets.mjs` — scans `assets/pixel/arena/` for PNGs and regenerates `arenaAssets.ts`. Run after adding or removing arena backgrounds.
- Updated `GameArena.tsx` — imports from `arenaAssets` instead of inline `require()` calls; `ARENA_BACKGROUNDS` built via `Object.values(arenaAssets)`
- Documented script in CLAUDE.md (repo structure tree + data pipeline section)

**Verification:** tsc clean, 295 tests pass, copy audit clean (dev fixtures only)

### Session: March 18, 2026 (follow-up — img-gen pipeline + device testing)
**Focus:** Physical device build fix, ornamental asset pipeline, magenta keying overhaul

**Physical device (iOS):**
- Diagnosed map freeze on physical device: `MKLocalSearch.start()` was called from Expo Modules background queue — MapKit silently hangs off main thread; completion handler never fires; JS promise never resolves; loading state stuck permanently
- Fix: wrapped `MKLocalSearch` creation and `.start()` in `DispatchQueue.main.async {}` in `MapKitSearchModule.swift`
- iOS build: provisioning failure with `expo run:ios --device` — fixed by opening `FckFascists.xcworkspace` directly in Xcode; Xcode handles device registration and provisioning profile updates interactively
- CLAUDE.md updated with MKLocalSearch main-thread rule (do not remove dispatch wrapper)

**Ornamental asset pipeline (tools/img-gen/):**
- Created `scripts/generate_assets.py` — generates UI ornament assets via Gemini API from `asset-prompts.json`. Same API pattern as `generate.py`. CLI: `--all`, `--asset <id>`, `--dry-run`, `--force`. Prompts reference image before generation (y/n).
- Created `scripts/process_assets.py` — reads `asset-prompts.json` processing config, applies keying + slicing + nearest-neighbor scaling. Handles `grid_2x2` (4 files), `split_horizontal` (left/right), `auto_crop`, `crop_center`, `horizontal_band`. Output: `output/new/`. Raw input: `output/raw/UI Elements/`.
- Created `scripts/deploy_assets.py` — copies processed assets to `assets/pixel/`. Handles multi-file outputs via glob. Never deletes from target.
- `config.json` — cleared `reference_images` (was `["reference/ref1.png"]`); reference images now opt-in per run

**Magenta keying overhaul (`remove_magenta.py`):**
- Full rewrite with HSV-based detection (replaces RGB Euclidean distance). Candidate = hue 285-345deg, saturation >=0.35, value >=0.25, red-minus-green >=26, blue-minus-green >=13
- Border-connected BFS flood fill (pure Python + PIL, no numpy/scipy required)
- Large interior region removal (`--interior-min-size`, default 250px) — catches magenta trapped inside closed shapes
- Optional conservative defringe pass (`--defringe`) — strips leftover pink edge pixels using 8-neighbor adjacency check
- Single-file mode: `remove_magenta.py input.png [output.png] [flags]`; `--output-dir` flag for batch and single-file mode
- Tuning flags exposed on CLI: `--hue-min`, `--hue-max`, `--min-sat`, `--min-val`, `--interior-min-size`
- Key tuning insight: to preserve dark purple clothing while removing bright magenta, raise `--min-val` (e.g. 0.65) — value (brightness) is the discriminator, not hue

**`process_assets.py` keying:**
- Removed scipy dependency; now delegates to `remove_magenta.remove_magenta()` via importlib (single source of keying logic)

**`gpt_image.py` updates:**
- Model updated to `gpt-image-1.5`
- Added `background="transparent"` and `output_format="png"` to `images.edit()` calls
- Fixed subcommand names (`--generate`/`--process` to `generate`/`process`) — argparse subparsers don't support `--` prefix names
- Fixed Python 3.9 compatibility: `Path | None` type annotation removed

**Files modified:**
- `modules/mapkit-search/ios/MapKitSearchModule.swift` — DispatchQueue.main.async wrapper
- `tools/img-gen/scripts/remove_magenta.py` — full rewrite (HSV flood-fill)
- `tools/img-gen/scripts/process_assets.py` — delegates keying to remove_magenta, output/new/, UI Elements input dir
- `tools/img-gen/scripts/gpt_image.py` — model 1.5, transparent bg, subcommand fix, Python 3.9 compat

**Files created:**
- `tools/img-gen/scripts/generate_assets.py`
- `tools/img-gen/scripts/deploy_assets.py`

### Session: March 18, 2026
**Focus:** Physical device visual refinement pass — 8 UI changes across 9 files

**Completed:**

**Launch screen:**
- Auto-dismiss increased from 3s to 5s for title screen feel
- Logo now 60% of screen width (was fixed 200pt) — more prominent on device
- Added subtle breathing scale animation on logo (1.0 to 1.04 to 1.0 loop, 3s period) — respects reduced motion
- Uses `Animated.Image` + `useWindowDimensions` for dynamic sizing

**Map screen:**
- Increased spacing between branded header bar and search bar — `paddingVertical: md` on header, `topOffset` uses `md` gap

**Business card:**
- Corner brackets repositioned: now sit ON the card border (top: -4, left/right: -4) with larger 36pt size
- Vertical padding compressed: WHO section `paddingBottom: sm`, WHY section `paddingBottom: sm`, `paddingTop: sm` on total label
- Reward overlay z-index raised to 10 (was 4) — now renders in front of sprite (z-index 5)
- Sprite increased from 120pt to 150pt; marginTop -80 (was -60) so sprite still stands on topband; marginLeft negative to encroach left

**Track screen:**
- "Edit platform selection" text now underlined (`textDecorationLine: 'underline'`) to read as tappable

**SpriteView:**
- New `headOnly` prop — clips to top 38% of sprite frame (head/face crop) via reduced container height
- No asset changes — same sprite sheet, overflow:hidden handles the crop

**GameArena:**
- Full bleed: removed `marginHorizontal`, arena now edge-to-edge
- Increased background opacity from 0.25 to 0.3
- `minHeight: 120` for taller arena section
- All sprites use `headOnly` — cell height adapted to cropped head proportion
- Arena roster now shows ALL tracked platforms (full `TRACKED_PLATFORMS` list), not just user's current selection — rogues' gallery, not a mirror of user choices

**Platform Row:**
- Grouped child rows indent deeper: `paddingLeft: 3xl` (was `xl`) — tree structure visual
- Row content (everything except avoid button) wrapped in a single `Pressable` for expand/collapse — not just the + icon
- Removed separate `chevronBtn` `Pressable` — chevron is now inside the row content touchable
- Second-tap auto-expand: if today already has count > 0 when avoid button is pressed, row auto-expands to show day circles, teaching the backfill mechanic organically

**Tab Bar:**
- Stone texture scaled up 2x via `transform: [{ scale: 2 }]` on `imageStyle` — pattern now visible at device resolution

**Files modified:**
- `features/Launch/LaunchScreen.tsx` — breathing logo animation, 5s dismiss, dynamic width
- `features/Map/MapScreen.tsx` — header bar padding, search bar gap
- `features/Map/components/BusinessCard.tsx` — corners, z-index, sprite size, tighter padding
- `features/Platforms/PlatformsScreen.tsx` — edit underline, arena all-platforms roster
- `core/sprites/spriteLoader.tsx` — `headOnly` prop on SpriteView
- `features/Platforms/components/GameArena.tsx` — full bleed, headOnly, taller, 0.3 bg opacity
- `features/Platforms/components/PlatformRow.tsx` — row tap target, indent, auto-expand
- `app/navigation/TabBar.tsx` — texture scale 2x

**Build:** tsc clean. 295 tests passing (27 suites). audit-copy.sh clean (dev-only fixtures only).

### Session: March 17, 2026 (follow-up 2)
**Focus:** Brand assets wired + GPT image pipeline tool

**Completed:**

**Brand logo wiring:**
- **Map header** — replaced text-based `{sharedCopy.appName}` with `<Image>` rendering `FF_logo_horizontal.png` (1536x322). Height 28pt, aspect ratio preserved. `accessibilityLabel={sharedCopy.appName}`.
- **Launch screen** — replaced text-based `appName` with `FF_logo.png` (1466x827) as hero image. Width 200pt, aspect ratio preserved, centered.
- **Onboarding welcome** — replaced text-based `appDisplay` with `FF_logo.png` as hero image. Same dimensions as launch screen. Added `sharedCopy` import for accessibility label.
- **App icon + splash** — `app.json` updated with `icon` and `splash` fields pointing to `FF_logo.png`. Splash background `#070B12` matches `theme.colors.bgVoid`.

**Arena backgrounds:**
- **GameArena** — replaced single tiled `bg_tile_dark_stone.png` with 4 arena scene backgrounds (`arena_sf`, `arena_byc_street`, `arena_nyc_penthouse`, `arena_dc`). Random selection via `useMemo` on mount. Changed `resizeMode` from `repeat` to `cover`.

**Asset manifest:**
- Added 6 new entries with status `"ready"`: `brand-logo-stacked`, `brand-logo-horizontal`, `arena-bg-sf`, `arena-bg-nyc-street`, `arena-bg-nyc-penthouse`, `arena-bg-dc`. Each includes dimensions, usage context, and fallback.

**GPT image pipeline (tools/img-gen/):**
- Created `scripts/gpt_image.py` — general-purpose GPT image tool using `gpt-image-1`. Two modes: `--generate` (text prompt to PNG, optional reference image) and `--process` (batch edit existing PNGs with natural-language instructions). Reads `OPENAI_API_KEY` from repo root `.env` via python-dotenv. Batch support with `[N/total]` progress, skip-on-error.
- Created `USAGE.md` — full documentation for all 8 scripts in the pipeline (generate, generate_assets, compose, remove_magenta, process_assets, deploy_assets, manifest, gpt_image). Pipeline overview section, all CLI flags, 2+ examples per script.
- Updated `requirements.txt` — added `openai`, `python-dotenv`, `scipy` (was imported but missing).

**Files created:**
- `tools/img-gen/scripts/gpt_image.py`
- `tools/img-gen/USAGE.md`

**Files modified:**
- `features/Map/MapScreen.tsx` — Image import, horizontal logo in header, headerLogo style
- `features/Launch/LaunchScreen.tsx` — Image import, stacked logo hero, heroLogo style
- `features/Onboarding/screens/WelcomeScreen.tsx` — Image import, sharedCopy import, stacked logo hero, heroLogo style
- `app.json` — icon and splash configuration
- `features/Platforms/components/GameArena.tsx` — arena backgrounds array, random selection, cover resize
- `design/asset-manifest.json` — 6 new asset entries
- `tools/img-gen/requirements.txt` — 3 new dependencies

**Build:** tsc clean. 295 tests passing (27 suites). audit-copy.sh clean.

### Session: March 17, 2026 (follow-up)
**Focus:** Device-testing-driven visual refinement pass

**Completed:**

**Map screen:**
- Search bar safe area fix — added `insets.top` to search bar offset so it clears the status bar on device
- Tap-to-dismiss backdrop — added `Pressable` overlay behind BusinessCard for dismissing by tapping the map
- Card container `overflow: 'visible'` to allow sprite perch to extend above card bounds

**Business card:**
- Sprite perch enlarged — 100 to 120pt, `marginTop: -60` + `zIndex: 5` so sprite stands ON TOP of card border
- WHY section divider softened — `hero` width `frameBlue` to 1px `surface2` (less visual noise)
- Reward overlay wired — `business_card_reward_overlay.png` fades in to 0.6 opacity over 400ms during 3s celebration
- Card `overflow: 'visible'` for sprite perch

**Avoid button:**
- Added debug `console.log` before haptic feedback call
- Visual depth — `bgVoid` top border + `highlightBlue` bottom border (2px each)

**Platforms screen (TRACK):**
- Removed "THE ARENA" title label from GameArena
- Arena padding reduced — `margin: md` to `marginHorizontal: sm, marginTop: sm`, `padding: md` to `sm`
- Arena background — `ImageBackground` with `bg_tile_dark_stone.png` at 25% opacity
- Sprite cells — `rewardYellow` 2px borders, `surface1` background, centered grid
- Short parent names — added `shortParentName()` to strip Inc/Corp/Platforms/.com and uppercase (e.g. "META" not "META PLATFORMS")
- Group header is ONLY sprite for grouped platforms — child rows hide sprites via `hideSprite` prop
- Grouped child rows compact — reduced vertical padding, left indent via `compact` prop
- Edit button restyled — bordered box to plain text link

**Info screen:**
- Tagline centered (`textAlign: 'center'`)
- Collapse indicator changed from triangle/triangle to +/- (matches FaqItem pattern)

**Global highlight line reduction:**
- TabBar top border: `hero` (4px) to `standard` (2px)
- InfoSection top border: `hero` to `standard`
- PlatformGroup top border: `hero` to `standard`

**Files modified:**
- `features/Map/MapScreen.tsx` — safe area offset, backdrop, overflow
- `features/Map/components/BusinessCard.tsx` — sprite perch, reward overlay, divider, overflow
- `features/Map/components/AvoidButton.tsx` — haptics debug log, depth borders
- `features/Platforms/PlatformsScreen.tsx` — shortParentName, grouped rows hideSprite+compact, edit button restyle
- `features/Platforms/components/GameArena.tsx` — removed title, ImageBackground, cell borders, padding
- `features/Platforms/components/PlatformGroup.tsx` — top border standard
- `features/Platforms/components/PlatformRow.tsx` — hideSprite, compact props
- `features/Info/InfoScreen.tsx` — centered tagline, +/- indicator
- `features/Info/components/InfoSection.tsx` — top border standard
- `app/navigation/TabBar.tsx` — top border standard

**Build:** Xcode build clean (0 errors).

### Session: March 17, 2026
**Focus:** Design refinement — 8-bit game energy across all screens, bug fixes, sprite halo removal

**Completed:**

**Bug fixes (7 fixes from device testing):**
- **Launch screen gate** — `shouldShowLaunchScreen()` was marking today as "seen" during onboarding before `isComplete` was true. Fixed: launch check deferred until `isComplete === true`. Loading guard also updated so onboarding renders without waiting for `showLaunch`.
- **Avoid dismiss timing** — business card dismissed instantly on avoid tap. Added 3s celebration delay with fade+shrink animation (`Animated.parallel` opacity/scale, 400ms ease-out, respects reduced-motion). `avoidedResult` state drives defeated sprite/topband during delay.
- **Multi-match re-tap** — tapping a pin at shared coordinates jumped to single card instead of showing chooser. Fixed: pin `onPress` now checks for colocated pins and routes to `setLatestTapBatch` when >=2.
- **Search pin drop** — text search was dropping map pins for businesses that might not be nearby. Added `isTextSearch` ref guard: pin effect skips when `isTextSearch.current === true`.
- **Chick-fil-A zeros** — entities with all-zero donation data (dissolved PACs) showed "$0 / $0". Added `hasRealDonations` guard; shows "No donation data on file." when all amounts are zero.
- **Day circles future style** — future day circles used `surface2` fill (identical to past unchecked). Changed to `transparent` background with `textSecondary` border, `opacity: 0.3`.
- **Corner brackets** — business card had only TL+TR corners. Not a bug but noted for future asset wiring.

**Design refinement — Steps 1-5 (from approved plan):**
- **Copy updates** — `copy/info.ts`: "HOW THE DATA WORKS" to "HOW IT WORKS". `copy/platforms.ts`: added `groupHeader`, `arenaTitle`. `copy/shared.ts`: added `totalSince2016`, `recentCycleShort`, `donationNoneOnFile`.
- **Map header bar** — branded "F*CK FASCISTS" header in `displayS` above the map, `surface1` background, `frameBlue` bottom border. Search bar repositioned below.
- **Search bar depth** — `highlightBlue` top border + `bgVoid` bottom border on container for embossed/inset look.
- **Tab bar texture** — `ImageBackground` with `bg_tile_dark_stone.png` tiled at 30% opacity behind tab bar. Icon size 22 to 26.
- **Business card layout rethink** — sprite LEFT at 100pt with name RIGHT (flexDirection: row). Donation hierarchy flipped: total since 2016 as primary (big, GOP red / DEM blue), recent cycle as secondary below. All-zero guard. `highlightBlue` top edge + `bgVoid` bottom edge ornamentation.

**Design refinement — Steps 6-9:**
- **MatchChooser visual upgrade** — heading color to `rewardYellow`. Row left accent: `highlightBlue` 2px border. Card depth: `highlightBlue` top border + `bgVoid` bottom border.
- **PlatformsScreen major restructure** — replaced `FlatList` with `ScrollView` for mixed arena+grouped content. New `GameArena.tsx` component (static sprite grid with cosmetic tap FX). New `PlatformGroup.tsx` component (parent company grouping with sprite bust + rolled-up total). Platforms grouped by `parentCompany` with group headers; singletons render without headers.
- **GameArena cosmetic tap interaction** — tapping any sprite triggers floating "-1" FX (fade+translate up, 600ms) + speech bubble with random reaction ("ow!", "stop!", "no!", "hey!" from `platformsCopy.spriteReactions`). Bubble fades after 1s. Per-cell animated values via `useRef(new Map<string, TapFx>())`. Reduced-motion: static bubble for 1s, no animation. Purely cosmetic — no data logged.
- **InfoScreen refinements** — transparency section now collapsible (default: collapsed) with toggle. Thicker dividers between transparency points (`hero` width). InfoSection ornamentation: `highlightBlue` top border + `bgVoid` bottom border on body.

**Sprite pipeline — 1px alpha erosion:**
- Added `_erode_alpha_1px()` to both `remove_magenta.py` and `process_assets.py` — removes the anti-aliased fringe halo that survives keying + binarization. For every opaque pixel, if any of its 4 cardinal neighbors is transparent, make it transparent. Vectorized numpy implementation.
- Processing order now: flood fill, global magenta pass, alpha binarization, 1px alpha erosion.
- Reprocessed all 124 PNGs via `remove_magenta.py`, 17/18 assets via `process_assets.py`, deployed 35 non-sprite assets + 107 sprite sheets to `assets/pixel/`.

**Files created:**
- `features/Platforms/components/GameArena.tsx` — sprite grid with cosmetic tap FX
- `features/Platforms/components/PlatformGroup.tsx` — parent company group header

**Files modified:**
- `App.tsx` — launch screen gate fix (deferred until `isComplete`)
- `app/navigation/TabBar.tsx` — `ImageBackground` texture, icon size 26
- `copy/info.ts` — "HOW IT WORKS" rename
- `copy/platforms.ts` — `groupHeader`, `arenaTitle`, `spriteReactions`
- `copy/shared.ts` — `totalSince2016`, `recentCycleShort`, `donationNoneOnFile`
- `features/Info/InfoScreen.tsx` — collapsible transparency, thicker dividers
- `features/Info/components/InfoSection.tsx` — `highlightBlue` top + `bgVoid` bottom borders
- `features/Map/MapScreen.tsx` — header bar, avoid dismiss animation, search pin guard, colocated pin routing
- `features/Map/components/BusinessCard.tsx` — sprite-left layout, donation hierarchy flip, all-zero guard, depth borders
- `features/Map/components/MapSearchBar.tsx` — depth borders
- `features/Map/components/MatchChooser.tsx` — `rewardYellow` heading, row left accent, depth borders
- `features/Map/hooks/useTapSearch.ts` — exposed `setLatestTapBatch`
- `features/Platforms/PlatformsScreen.tsx` — arena + grouping restructure
- `features/Platforms/components/DayCircles.tsx` — future circle style fix
- `tools/img-gen/scripts/process_assets.py` — `_erode_alpha_1px` step 4
- `tools/img-gen/scripts/remove_magenta.py` — `_erode_alpha_1px` step 3
- 107 sprite PNGs + 35 asset PNGs reprocessed with erosion

**Build:** Xcode build clean (0 errors).

- iOS app built and running on simulator (FckFascists.app on iPhone 16 Pro)
- Browser extension built and tested on walmart.com (Chrome)
- Entity matching pipeline with confidence labels, FEC API integration (anonymous mode)
- Design system: `design/tokens.ts` + all 26 components migrated to theme tokens
- Pixel art assets: 107 CEO sprites + 35 UI assets deployed, 4-step keying pipeline (flood fill, global magenta, binarization, 1px alpha erosion)
- Track screen: reducer-driven focus, FlatList layout, GameArena with 4 arena backgrounds, parent company grouping, day circles
- Shared FX system (`core/fx/`): FXLayer + useFX + effect registry with avoid celebration
- App architecture: App.tsx (112 lines) → OnboardingGate → LaunchGate → AppShell; all files under 250 lines
- Barcode scan (beta): dedicated Scan tab, UPC-A/EAN-13, Open Food Facts resolution, SQLite cache
- AIRMap.m nil guard patch automated via Podfile `post_install` hook

## What's Not Working / Not Yet Built

| Item | Status | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Physical device geolocation test | Not done | V1 needed |
| 3 entities pending retry (sherwin-williams, baker-hughes, chick-fil-a) | Run plain fetch:donations | Nice to have |
| people.json individual donor data | Not started | V1.5 |
| Copy naming cleanup (Label suffix inconsistencies) | Deferred | Pre-1.0 |
| Scorecard sharing / social export | Not built | V2 |

---

## Immediate Next Steps (in order)

1. **iOS simulator smoke test** — launch from simulator, walk the full vertical slice (map scan → flag → business card with topband art → avoid tap with haptics → platforms → scorecard). Verify pixel art markers render on map, topband/corners render in business card, onboarding flows through 3 screens, launch screen appears once per day, beta mode toggle works.
2. **Physical device geolocation** — test on hardware, not simulator
3. **Wire remaining pixel art assets** — `marker_flag_selected.png` (selected state), `corners_yellow_reward_0-3.png` (reward corners), `bottom_nav_shell.png`, `search_shell_caps`, `scorecard_preview_stamp`, `onboarding_hero_welcome`, FX animation frames. `business_card_reward_overlay.png` already wired.

---

## Open Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Context | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Map POI tap scope | Full pipeline match used (alias first, FEC fuzzy fallback) | Resolved — full pipeline |
| Extension + scorecard unification | QR code bridge or permanently separate | Deferred V2 |
| App Store name | "F*ck Fascists" will be rejected — need clean submission name | Not resolved |
| Uber entity | No PAC found, name-based match failing | Needs manual research |

---

## Agent Roster

| Agent | Current task |
|---|---|
| Lead Architect (this session) | Documentation, decisions, CC prompt generation |
| Claude Code | Implementation — awaiting next prompt |
| Codex | Not yet onboarded — use for data cleaning and pipeline work |
| Web Agent | Idle — next task: Hyatt subsidiary PAC verification |

---

## Recently Resolved Decisions

- OpenSecrets → FEC.gov as primary data source
- Schedule B disbursements for partisan attribution (not committee totals)
- fecCommitteeId three-state schema (string / null / "")
- verificationStatus numeric migration
- matchScore removed from Entity type
- App / extension material data-state changes must stay in parity unless explicitly deferred to V2
- Tesla → null (no corporate PAC, Musk donates personally)
- Patagonia → removed (IE filer only, no Republican history)
